    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egg fried rice is a versatile and delightful dish that's quick to prepare and perfect for using up <em>leftover
            rice</em>.
        The recipe begins by heating a bit of oil in a large skillet or wok,
        where finely chopped <strong>onions</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong>,
        and vegetables like <strong>peas</strong>, <strong>carrots</strong>, or <strong>bell peppers</strong> are
        sautéed until tender.
        The leftover rice is then added to the pan, and it’s <em>crucial</em> to break up any clumps and stir-fry it
        until it’s heated through and <em>slightly</em> crispy.
        To infuse the rice with flavor, <strong>soy sauce</strong>, and a touch of <strong>sesame oil</strong> are
        incorporated, giving the dish a savory depth.</p>
    <p>Next, beaten <strong>eggs</strong> are poured into the pan and scrambled until just set.
        The eggs are then mixed into the rice, ensuring even distribution and a creamy texture.
        For added flavor and a touch of freshness, chopped green onions and a sprinkle of <strong>white pepper</strong>
        are stirred in just before serving.
        Garnish with a few extra green onions or a drizzle of soy sauce if desired.
        This simple yet satisfying dish is a wonderful canvas for customization,
        allowing you to add ingredients like cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu to enhance its heartiness.</p>
