<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Egg fried rice is a versatile and delightful dish that's quick to prepare and perfect for using up <em>leftover rice</em>. 
   The recipe begins by heating a bit of oil in a large skillet or wok, 
   where finely chopped <strong>onions</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong>, 
   and vegetables like <strong>peas</strong>, <strong>carrots</strong>, or <strong>bell peppers</strong> are sautéed until tender. 
   The leftover rice is then added to the pan, and it’s <em>crucial</em> to break up any clumps and stir-fry it until it’s heated through and <em>slightly</em> crispy. 
   To infuse the rice with flavor, <strong>soy sauce</strong>, and a touch of <strong>sesame oil</strong> are incorporated, giving the dish a savory depth.</p>
<p>Next, beaten <strong>eggs</strong> are poured into the pan and scrambled until just set. 
   The eggs are then mixed into the rice, ensuring even distribution and a creamy texture.
   For added flavor and a touch of freshness, chopped green onions and a sprinkle of <strong>white pepper</strong> are stirred in just before serving. 
   Garnish with a few extra green onions or a drizzle of soy sauce if desired. 
   This simple yet satisfying dish is a wonderful canvas for customization,
   allowing you to add ingredients like cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu to enhance its heartiness.</p>
