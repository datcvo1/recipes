    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Curry udon is a comforting and hearty Japanese noodle dish that combines thick, chewy udon noodles with a rich
        and flavorful curry sauce.
        To start, a savory curry base is made by simmering <strong>onions</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong>,
        and <strong>ginger</strong> in a pot with a bit of oil until they become fragrant and translucent.
        Next, <strong>curry roux</strong> or curry powder is added along with vegetable or <strong>chicken
            broth</strong>, creating a thick, aromatic sauce.
        This curry mixture is allowed to simmer and thicken, absorbing the robust flavors of the spices and melding
        together into a smooth sauce.</p>
    <p>Once the curry sauce is ready, cooked <strong>udon noodles</strong> are added to the pot and stirred to coat them
        evenly with the curry sauce.
        You can also include additional ingredients such as <strong>sliced mushrooms</strong>, <strong>bok
            choy</strong>,
        or <strong>sliced chicken</strong> to enhance the dish's texture and flavor.
        The curry udon is simmered briefly to ensure the noodles are well-coated and heated through.
        Garnish with sliced <strong>green onions</strong> or a sprinkle of <strong>sesame seeds</strong>,
        and serve hot for a satisfying meal that's both comforting and full of flavor.</p>
