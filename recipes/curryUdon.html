<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Curry udon is a comforting and hearty Japanese noodle dish that combines thick, chewy udon noodles with a rich and flavorful curry sauce. 
    To start, a savory curry base is made by simmering <strong>onions</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong>, 
    and <strong>ginger</strong> in a pot with a bit of oil until they become fragrant and translucent.
    Next, <strong>curry roux</strong> or curry powder is added along with vegetable or <strong>chicken broth</strong>, creating a thick, aromatic sauce. 
    This curry mixture is allowed to simmer and thicken, absorbing the robust flavors of the spices and melding together into a smooth sauce.</p>
<p>Once the curry sauce is ready, cooked <strong>udon noodles</strong> are added to the pot and stirred to coat them evenly with the curry sauce.
     You can also include additional ingredients such as <strong>sliced mushrooms</strong>, <strong>bok choy</strong>, 
     or <strong>sliced chicken</strong> to enhance the dish's texture and flavor. 
     The curry udon is simmered briefly to ensure the noodles are well-coated and heated through. 
     Garnish with sliced <strong>green onions</strong> or a sprinkle of <strong>sesame seeds</strong>, 
     and serve hot for a satisfying meal that's both comforting and full of flavor.</p>
