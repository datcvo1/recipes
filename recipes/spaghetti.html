<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spaghetti is a timeless Italian dish that's both simple and satisfying. 
    To make it, cook spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente, which usually takes about 8-12 minutes. 
    Meanwhile, prepare a savory tomato sauce by saut√©ing onions and garlic in olive oil, 
    then adding crushed tomatoes, herbs like basil and oregano, and simmering until the flavors meld together. 
    For added depth, you can include ground meat, mushrooms, or other vegetables. 
    Once the spaghetti is cooked and drained, toss it with the sauce to ensure the noodles are well-coated. 
    Serve with a generous sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and fresh basil for a classic and comforting meal.</p>
